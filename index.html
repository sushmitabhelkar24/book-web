            A book is a portable medium for recording information, traditionally consisting of multiple paper pages bound together along one edge and protected by covers. It serves as a tool for communication, containing written, printed, or illustrated works of fiction or non-fiction. In the digital age, books also exist as electronic files (e-books) or audio recordings. <br/>
            Book types are primarily categorized into fiction (imaginary stories) and non-fiction (factual information), further divided into genres like  thriller, comedy, biography, and self-help. Common formats include printed books, e-books, and audiobooks. Major genres include popular fiction (fantasy, science fiction, mystery) and informative non-fiction (history, memoirs, textbooks). <br/>
